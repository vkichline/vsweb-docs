## Razor
The ASP.NET Razor syntax allows you to inline C# directly inside
your views. 

You've got full access to the current `Model` as well
as the entire .NET framework types available.

## Tag Helpers
coming soon...

## Tilde slash
You can use the tilde (~) character in Razor markup to indicate the root
of the website. This is particularly useful when the root of the application
is located in a subfolder of an existing website.

## Model driven development
The models used in an ASP.NET application can be annotated to provide
a wide range of experiences such as database schema generation,
view scaffolding, client- and server-side validation and more.

### Model annotations
Annotate your models to generate the database schema and scaffold views.

### Validation
Annotations will also ensure both server- and client-side validation.

### Scaffolding
In the works...

### Dynamic templating
coming soon...

## Roslyn compiler
The .NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn") provides open-source C# and 
Visual Basic compilers with rich code analysis APIs. 

It enables building code analysis tools with the same APIs that are 
used by Visual Studio.

## Environment awareness
The app specific configuration defaults to have environment settings override
the configuration in the projects.

## Code based configuration
Any identity, routing and database configuration is code based to give
full fidelity to the logic need for any web app.
